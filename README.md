### about me

i'm really into continuous proess improvement and automation. i've collected these ideas into a concept called [zero-diff](https://zerodiff.org).

of all the things i've ever done with zero-diff, i find this is the most transformative: [read-with-a-pen](https://tinyletter.com/zerodiff/letters/zerodiff-efficient-kaizen-read-with-a-pen) (tho' it has evolved a lot!)

### what i'm working on these days

during my time at autodesk i developed new zero-diff ideas around gitops and immutable infrastructure and i decided to venture off into the wilderness to develop them into code and tools: [karrots](https://karrots.app). we'll see where it ends up, but right now with a single command you can bring up a fully functional kubernetes production environment that can scale from just a few apps to thousands that can millions of transactions.
