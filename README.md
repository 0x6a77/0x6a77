### about me

i'm really into continuous proess improvement and automation. i've collected these ideas into a concept called [zero-diff](https://zerodiff.org).

of all the things i've ever done with zero-diff, i find this is the most transformative: [read-with-a-pen](https://tinyletter.com/zerodiff/letters/zerodiff-efficient-kaizen-read-with-a-pen) (tho' it has evolved a lot!)

### what i'm working on these days

during my time at autodesk i conceptualized new zero-diff ideas based on gitops and immutable infrastructure. i ventured into the wilderness to express those ideas as code and tools: [karrots](https://karrots.app). we'll see where it ends up! tho' today a single command can bring up a fully functional kubernetes production environment that scales from just a few apps to thousands that can handle millions of transactions. 

for now i've decided to focus karrots on building cool environments for data science teams
