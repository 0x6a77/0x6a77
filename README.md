#### Karrots.app

I'm the co-founder of [karrots.app](https://karrots.app), a SaaS tool that builds and manages a full data plaform in your cloud account.

We handle your data team's devops so your analysts can focus on what they do best. We get you there in days and weeks â€” not months and years.

#### Technologies that I use regularly:

* kubernetes
* golang
* kotlin
* python
* typescript
* terraform (and now open tofu!)
* llama2/code-llama
* postgres/sql/dbt
